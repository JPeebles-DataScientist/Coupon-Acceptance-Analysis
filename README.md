# Coupon Acceptance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis of coupon acceptance behavior among drivers, with a focus on different coupon types such as bar and coffee house offers. The analysis explores various factors that may influence a driver's likelihood of accepting a coupon, including passenger presence, time of day, and individual driver characteristics.

## Key Insights

- **Bar Coupons:**
  - Drivers alone or with friends show higher acceptance rates for bar coupons, suggesting a correlation between social settings and coupon use.
  - Younger drivers and those frequenting bars more than once a month are particularly receptive to bar-related offers.
  - Drivers who often dine at inexpensive restaurants and have a lower income appear less interested in bar coupons.

- **Coffee House Coupons:**
  - Individuals driving alone have a strong tendency to accept coffee house coupons, indicating a preference for coffee breaks during solo drives.
  - The presence of friends also increases coupon acceptance, potentially reflecting social coffee-drinking behaviors.
  - Coupon redemption is less common among drivers accompanied by partners or children.
  - Acceptance rates peak at traditional coffee times, specifically around 10 AM and early evening.
